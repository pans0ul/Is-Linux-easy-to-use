# Is Linux easy to use
When Linux was born, there was no graphical interface, and users could only interact with computers through the command line.
At that time, computer interfaces were mostly black and white terminals, and all operations were realized by inputting various commands on the command line.
Even now, although linux provides a graphical interface and UI, developers still need to use cmd for various system operations. The premise is that we learn how to use cmd. For example, common commands, such as ls, cd, mkdir, top, df, du, cat, grep, find, vi, etc. Linux provides hundreds of common commands, which cover file management, user management, network configuration, system monitoring and other aspects.
Users can check the man provided by linux to see how to use a command, or find the command that wants to specify an operation through apropos. But sometimes even after reading these manuals, they don't know how to use it, and they need to attach various parameters. If they don't use it often, they will easily forget it. For novices and novices, the curve of learning linux is very steep.

In my years of linux development, I found that some commands are very easy to use, while others are complicated and difficult to remember.
If the commands of an operating system are difficult to use, the usability of the operating system itself will be greatly reduced, which will affect its popularity.
Therefore, in order to improve the usability of linux, on the one hand, we can start from the aspect of cmd and make a multi-dimensional score for all cmds commonly used in Linux. For example, the evaluation is made from the following dimensions:

- Ease of use: whether the command can easily achieve the goal.
- Easy to remember: whether the command is easy to remember and avoid frequent forgetting.
- Composability: the cooperation and compatibility between commands and other commands.

Every command should accept such a score. If the score of a cmd can't reach the passing score, then the cmd should be pushed to the upstream community, telling the author that it is time for them to optimize this cmd, or some related engineers develop a new cmd with the same function, and the old cmd will be replaced by the newly developed cmd and integrated into the new version of Linux.
In this way, Linux system will become easier to use and more popular. We expect a more friendly Linux operating system to help users complete various tasks more efficiently.



# Linux 好用吗? 
Linux在诞生之初是没有图形界面的，用户只能通过命令行与计算机进行互动。
那时，计算机界面大多是黑白色的终端，所有操作都依赖于在命令行中输入各种命令来实现。
即便是现在，虽然linux提供了图形界面和UI，但是开发者还是要用到cmd进行各种系统操作。前提是我们学会了如何使用cmd。例如常用的命令, ls, cd, mkdir, top, df, du, cat, grep, find, vi 等等Linux 提供了几百个常用命令，它们涵盖了文件管理、用户管理、网络配置、系统监控等各个方面。
用户可以查看linux提供的man查看某个指令的使用方法, 或者通过apropos 找到想要指定操作的命令. 但是有时候即使看过了这些手册, 但也不知道如何使用, 而且还需要附带各种各样的参数, 如果没有经常使用就很容易忘, 对于新手和菜鸟来说, 学习linux的曲线非常陡峭.

在我多年的linux开发中, 我发现一些命令非常易用，而另一些命令则复杂难记。
如果一个操作系统的命令都很难用，那么这个操作系统本身的易用性也会大打折扣，进而影响它的普及程度。
因此，为了提高 Linux 的易用性，第一方面可以从 cmd 方面着手, 对所有linux中常用的cmd 做一个多维度的评分。例如，从以下几个维度进行评估：

- 易用性：命令能否轻松实现目标。
- 易记性：命令是否容易记住，避免频繁遗忘。
- 可组合性：命令与其他命令之间的协作性和兼容性。

每个命令都应该接受这样的评分，如果某个cmd 的评分不能达到及格分数, 那么这个cmd应该被推动到上游社区, 告诉作者他们这个cmd到了应该优化的时候了, 或者有相关工程师开发一个新的cmd具备解决相同的功能, 而老旧的cmd将会新开发的cmd替代，并集成到Linux的新版本中。
通过这种方式，Linux 系统将变得更加易用，更加普及。我们期待一个更加友好的 Linux 操作系统，帮助用户更高效地完成各种任务。
